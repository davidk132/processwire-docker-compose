# About this ProcessWire Setup

Dockerfile. Sets up the instance of PHP and Apache in its own container, including the specific dependencies required by ProcessWire. The dependencies are loaded and configured through a file called `local.ini` which is similar to `php.ini`. See PHP documentation for more info. I am choosing `local.ini` in order to avoid PHP upgrade issues in the future. This is probably unnecessary for a development site, however your future self should be your best friend. I like to think about what possible future problems I can avoid with what we know now.

docker-compose.yml. Builds MySQL in its own container and links it with the PHP/Apache container in a common network. It also sets up a folder for your website data in a location on the host (i.e. your laptop computer).

init.sh (required). This is a bash script that sets up `local.ini` (mentioned above) and runs the server. This could also happen within 'docker-compose.yml' however things get complicated when you're tryint to create a new directory (i.e. `/conf.d` for the `local.ini` file) inside Docker Compose.

## Setting up your instance of ProcessWire

Mysql database name, user and password are 'root' as defined in docker-compose.yml.

Database host: If 'localhost' doesn't work, go to the command line and type

`docker network ls`

to get the name of the Docker network you're on. In my case it was 'processwire_default'. With this, type

`docker network inspect processwire_default`

or whatever is the name of your network. Scroll to the section that describes your database container and look for `IPv4Address`. Enter that (without the suffix, i.e. '/16') in the database host box on the set up form on the ProcessWire install page.

Sample Docker network list of containers:

           "IPv6Address": ""
       },
       ...
     }
```

## Known issues and caveats
* The containers should be set to `restart: always` because otherwise MySQL on occasion may decide  to stop working before you get it even set up.
* The setup page may sometimes record your admin username and password, and then promptly lose it. I have no idea why this happens, however it is most definitely a fatal condition unless you go into `phpMyAdmin` and manually change it. See docs for more details.
* This is not tested in any kind of production environment, so don't use it! This is for quickly spinning up a copy of ProcessWire to see what the fuss is all about or build a site for someone. While you're at it, you'll get to learn some of the finer points of configuring a PHP/Apache install.
